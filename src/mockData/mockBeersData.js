"description": "A straw-coloured ale that is re-fermented in the bottleIts dry and robust character charms devotees of both special and pilsner beers. Is this due to the 3 varieties of hops used? Or perhaps its delicate citrus aroma? One thing is for sure. Ommegang tastes like no other beer. It’s the ultimate thirst quencher.",

"shortName": "Belgian Pale Strong",
"description": "Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength. Often brewed with light colored Belgian candy sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

"description": "Started in 1893 as a dairy farm. Eugène de Ro brewed his first top-fermented beer in 1898. 4 years later he was also brewing bottom-fermented beers. In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.",
